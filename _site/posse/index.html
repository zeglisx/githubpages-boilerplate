          <p>Mozilla is building an Open Source Student Club program dedicated to creating and supporting a network of clubs on university and college campuses around the world who are learning about and contributing to open source projects and open web technologies.</p>

<p>Our vision is to create a new generation of students who have a better understanding of open source, open practises and who are actively contributing.</p>

<p>We’d love your help in making this program a success and have put together some additional information below about the program and how to get involved.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-support-the-program">How can I support the program?</h3>

<p>Help us find diverse student leaders who can help us build and shape the program for the US, read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZOP4DNMIUrMxKMEZTdR3IgAP4eJKnAPZ5pcVkicwzU/pub">the description</a> and nominate a student, or pair of students, using the link below.</p>

<p><strong>The nomination form is now open: <a href="http://mzl.la/2oq69FW">mzl.la/2oq69FW</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>This form will close at midnight (EST) on Friday, May 5th.</strong></p>

<p>Contribute to the creation of an intro to open source training. Email us at <a href="mailto:campusclubs@mozilla.com">campusclubs@mozilla.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-current-state-of-the-program">What is the current state of the program?</h3>

<p>In Spring 2017, we currently have <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/connect/">180 active Clubs</a>, primarily in asia, who are running a wide variety of activities related to the open web. However we currently have very few active clubs in the USA where we’re looking to bring a focus on empowering and connecting existing open source clubs by providing training, content and connection opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="whats-happening-in-the-rest-of-2017">What’s happening in the rest of 2017?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spring</strong> - Recruiting and selecting 20 Student Leaders who will help shape and launch the program in the US in September</li>
  <li><strong>Summer</strong> - Training and working with our 20 Student Leaders to prepare for our September launch</li>
  <li><strong>Fall</strong> - Initial Clubs launch in the US</li>
  <li><strong>Winter</strong> - Invite more Clubs to join the program</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-is-mozilla-interested-in-open-source-on-campuses">Why is Mozilla interested in open source on campuses?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla’s mission</a> is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.</p>

<p>We believe that students are uniquely positioned to make a difference and that by bringing together and supporting local groups who care about open source and the open internet we can meaningfully advance this mission.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-a-club-register-with-mozilla">Why should a club register with Mozilla?</h3>

<p>By registering their Club with Mozilla, students will have access to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A Network</strong> of mentors, professionals, and other student groups who share their passion for open.</li>
  <li><strong>Activities &amp; Challenges</strong> designed to develop their skills and get students excited about contributing to open source projects and open web technologies.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-kinds-of-clubs-can-register-with-mozilla">What kinds of Clubs can register with Mozilla?</h3>

<p>Any existing open source or technology focused Club who are interested in contributing to open source projects can register with Mozilla.</p>

<p>Students who are interested in starting a new open source club can also register with us and we’ll provide support for the set-up and initial launch.</p>

<h3 id="do-clubs-need-to-change-their-names-or-adopt-the-mozilla-branding-in-any-way-to-register-with-mozilla">Do Clubs need to change their names or adopt the Mozilla branding in any way to register with Mozilla?</h3>

<p>No - Clubs don’t have to change their name/branding or adopt the Mozilla branding to be a registered club.</p>

<h3 id="when-can-us-clubs-start-registering">When can US clubs start registering?</h3>

<p>They can register on our <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/">website</a> at anytime, however we’ll be launching the US version of the program in September with a new site. Existing student clubs can also support the program by trying out and providing feedback on our <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/activities/">activities</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-canada">What about Canada?</h3>

<p>While the primary focus of this launch will be the USA we’re also inviting Canadian universities and students to participate in every stage of the process.</p>
